# Metadata Folder

This folder contains metadata files that will be used for app store listings in the future.

## Current Status

⚠️ **App is not yet published on any platform**

These files are placeholders from the original forked project and will need to be updated before publishing to:
- Google Play Store
- F-Droid
- Other app distribution platforms

## Files to Update Before Publishing

- `en-US/title.txt` - App title
- `en-US/short_description.txt` - Short description for store listing
- `en-US/full_description.txt` - Full app description
- `en-US/images/` - Screenshots, feature graphics, and icons for store listings

## Next Steps

When ready to publish:
1. Update all text files with your own descriptions
2. Replace screenshots with current app screenshots
3. Update feature graphic and icon if needed
4. Add translations for other languages if desired
